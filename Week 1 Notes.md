## History

Ez. 14 - Mentions Job written ~6th c. BC

* Job was written sometime between Moses and Ezekiel

### ANE Literature

* Ugaritic Keret - Loses Sons, regains them through prayer
* Akkadian Ladlul Bel Nemiqi - Hymn of thanks and delivery
* Sumerian Sufferer- Divine relief from tormentor
* Indian Harishchandra - Wager
* Egyptian dispute or suicide

>*God will use contemporary concepts and re-use them for His purposes*

We don't need to fight that hard to make Judaism unique. On the other had, it is preposterous to say the ANE was a monoculture and nothing Jewish was unique.

## Characters

* Job - Didn't use YHWH, only Elohim. Probably not Jewish
* God - YHWH is used in the Prologue
* Satan - Chief Accuser Rev. 12:10
* Job's wife - 1-Dimensional
* Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar - "miserable comforters"

>*The real reason Job went through his suffering was because he was so righteous*

## Story

1. Satan and God have a wager over Job
2. Job's friends come to comfort him be but end up accusing him
3. God shows up and asks Job a series of questions and criticizing Job and his friends
4. Job humbles himself and God restores his health and wealth

Dramatic Irony - THe reader is aware of something the characters aren't
Imagery - Vivid descriptions, metaphors, simile
Parallelism - Couplets of varying kinds

## Motifs

Larger motifs, the courtroom. Law, justice
Karmic law is false --> The righteous are blessed and the wicked cursed
Our ignorance of God's plan in our lives
Our impotence before (apparent) chaos, and more seriously before God's glory.

# Job Week 3 - Chapter 28

>Job is repetitive maybe to point out how futile man in his own reasoning is, that their arguments got nowhere

| Job 28    | Summary  | Book Ch. | Parallel |
| ---       |  ---    | --- | --- |
| vv. 1-11  | Man's Tenacity, Skill and ingenuity | 3-37 | Clever argument, analyses |
| vv. 12-22 | The Above Falls Short of Wisdom | | Little progress in making sense of Job's situation |
|           | Riches Cannot buy wisdom| | Job's wealth falls short of his connection with God|
| vv. 23-28 | Fear of the Lod is the beginning of understanding |38-42 | Emphasis on humility |
| | God's Superiority over nature (24-26) | | God's Superiority over Nature |

For all their ingenuity, humans cannot gain wisdom. Even the material wealth they gain cannot be traded for wisdom.

God points out to Job that he is unable to find out the reason for his suffering because he is not god.

It takes a consistent refusal to listen to deny God.

Ironic breakdown of technology in Modern society

* Access tot he world's information, but total lack of ability to retain it or think deeply about it.
* Huge advancement in technology built on the back of scientific principles that are founded on the belief in truth claims.

Let's take the opportunity to (briefly) Analyze the larger concept of Biblical wisdom.
Proverbs is the paragon of wisdom

Lady Wisdom and Folly, parallel each other.

>Wisdom is *directed* humility: *Submission*. Submission to God

Job 28:28, Proverbs 1:7, 9:10 - The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.

1 Cor. 13 - Knowledge isn't enough

Proverbs 3:5-7 --

1 Cor 10:12 - If you think you stand be careful you are likely to fall
Proverbs 26:12 -- Do you see a man that is wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him.

The beginning of wisdom isn't an emptying, it is seeing ourselves accurately relative to God.

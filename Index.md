## History

Ez. 14 - Mentions Job written ~6th c. BC

* Job was written sometime between Moses and Ezekiel

### ANE Literature

* Ugaritic Keret - Loses Sons, regains them through prayer
* Akkadian Ladlul Bel Nemiqi - Hymn of thanks and delivery
* Sumerian Sufferer- Divine relief from tormentor
* Indian Harishchandra - Wager
* Egyptian dispute or suicide

>*God will use contemporary concepts and re-use them for His purposes*

We don't need to fight that hard to make Judaism unique. On the other had, it is preposterous to say the ANE was a monoculture and nothing Jewish was unique.

## Characters

* Job - Didn't use YHWH, only Elohim. Probably not Jewish
* God - YHWH is used in the Prologue
* Satan - Chief Accuser Rev. 12:10
* Job's wife - 1-Dimensional
* Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar - "miserable comforters"

>*The real reason Job went through his suffering was because he was so righteous*

## Story

1. Satan and God have a wager over Job
2. Job's friends come to comfort him be but end up accusing him
3. God shows up and asks Job a series of questions and criticizing Job and his friends
4. Job humbles himself and God restores his health and wealth

Dramatic Irony - THe reader is aware of something the characters aren't
Imagery - Vivid descriptions, metaphors, simile
Parallelism - Couplets of varying kinds

## Motifs

Larger motifs, the courtroom. Law, justice
Karmic law is false --> The righteous are blessed and the wicked cursed
Our ignorance of God's plan in our lives
Our impotence before (apparent) chaos, and more seriously before God's glory.
# The Comforters
## Who Are the Friends?
* **Eliphaz** - Edomite (Cf. Gen 36:4); Senior member of the friends, most sympathetic
* **Zophar**- Unclear origins; "Namathite" (only appears in Job), Most caustic of the friends, "repent or die!"
* **Bildad** - Also from a on-Jewish Abrahamic tribe; means Adad (storm God) is Lord (Ba'al) > see conclusion. Less sympathetic, but slightly more erudite that Zophar

## Eliphaz
* 4:7 - Remember now, who ever perished being innocent? Or where were the upright destroyed?
* Proverbs 14:11 - The house of the wicked will be destroyed, but the tent of the upright will flourish.
* Psalm 1 
* How do such biblical claims interact with what we know is happening to Job
    * Proverbs describes how things usually go, God isn't a relativistic judge. But is absolutely merciful. Jer. 13:11
## Bildad
* 8:8-10, 13b - Please inquire of past generations, and consider the things searched out by their fathers
## Zophar
* 11:2; 14-15
# Irony in the Dialogues
1. They accuse Job of not listening. THis a doubly ironic:
    1. They keep pounding on the Karmic thesis in different ways; i.e. they are not listening to Job (only hearing)
    2. They, in turn, become accusers. Like Satan.
    3. Job's position is quite nuanced
        1. Job directly responds to what they say
        2. But they seem to ignore them
        3. While the comforters go in circles, Job's argument develops.
2. The comforter are the actually guilty ones but they do not suffer. God let's them go. Job 42:7

# Terrifying Glory of God
* 9:1-5 - â€œIndeed, I know that this is true.
    But how can mere mortals prove their innocence before God?  
3 Though they wished to dispute with him,  
    they could not answer him one time out of a thousand.  
4 His wisdom is profound, his power is vast.  
    Who has resisted him and come out unscathed?  
5 He moves mountains without their knowing it  
    and overturns them in his anger.  
6 He shakes the earth from its place  
    and makes its pillars tremble.  
7 He speaks to the sun and it does not shine;  
    he seals off the light of the stars.  
8 He alone stretches out the heavens  
    and treads on the waves of the sea.  
9 He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion,  
    the Pleiades and the constellations of the south.  
10 He performs wonders that cannot be fathomed,  
    miracles that cannot be counted.  
* Job 12:23, 24 - He makes nations great, and destroys them;  
    he enlarges nations, and disperses them. 
24 He deprives the leaders of the earth of their reason;  
    he makes them wander in a trackless waste  
* Isaiah 40:15, 17 - 

* Job Anticipates his own ignorance in the face of God
* Job appreciates God's divine prerogative

## The Wicked Prosper for a Time
* Job 24
* Psalm 73
## Advocate
* 16:19-21
* 19:25-26

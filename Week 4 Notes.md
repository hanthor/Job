## Elihu

An interpretive tension for the Elihu monologue:

- He is not mentioned before he speaks (e.g. he is not mentioned among the friends in the prologue)
- He is not mentioned after he speaks (e.g. he is not mentioned by God in the epilogue)
- The whole discussion appears to transpire on Job's property, so He's presumable been there all along

| Proposal                                     | Problem                                      |
| ---                                          | ---                                          |
| Because the whole section is a late addition | General problems with documentary hypotheses |
| Because he's young                           | But not too young for 6 chapter diatribe?    |
| Because he merely recapitulates E, B, Z      | Some parts significantly improve upon E,B,Z  |

### Elihu's Introduction

Very verbose compared to his friends.

Positive - He anticipates God's arrival

* 36:27-37:24 References to a storm
* A very high view of God (even to the point of denying God's emotions)
* Job 35:8 in contrast to Psalm 51. We don't affect God.
* Mostly avoids the karmic law perspective
* Job 33:29-30 - He sees that God may use suffering a discipline

Negative - Erroneous Assessment of Job's words. Refute these using Job's words:

1. 33:9 - 'I am pure, without transgression'
2. 34:9
3. 35:2

Elihu sets up Job's words as a straw man so they can dismantle his arguments

## God

* 38:1 God appears to Job out of the storm.
* Appears there is a storm. See Elihu's reference to a storm.

### Big Picture

* God is both all-knowing and all-powerful
* Man is both ignorant and impotent

> The will be times that you will never know why you were suffering. God never explains what happened to Job. He merely points to Job's complete lack of knowledge

* Ch. 28 - Man pretends to have control and knowledge. We take a small amount of progress and grossly overestimate the knowledge we have.

A Few Lessons:

* If Job doesn't know what's happening within the sensible world (what he can see), he shouldn't be surprised that he doesn't know what's happening in place he cannot see.
* Striking omission: Jobs righteousness/wickedness is not really mentioned at all.
